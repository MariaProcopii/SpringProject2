# Drive Buddy

We have problems with intercity transport and it's difficult for students to get to the univercity. My goal was to create 
a web application which would provide an opportunity for drivers who travel in one dirrection to give students a lift for a small fee.

# What you can do:
In the app, you can register as a passanger or driver, create rides and view posted rides. Also you are able to change your profile 
information, view you booked rides or delete you profile.
